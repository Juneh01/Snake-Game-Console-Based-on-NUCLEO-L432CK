# Snake-Game-Console-Based-on-NUCLEO-L432CK
This is: Microelectronic Systems Course Project at UESTC

## Project Proposal
At the time when our fathers were kids, there were not such powerful game consoles like Playstation, Switch or Xbox, but they have enjoyed and challenged those classic games like Snake, Pac-Man, Tetris and so on. These games did not seek for best graphics or magnificent scene but created unique gameplay styles making players try and then improve. Therefore, as a student who is now learning microcontroller system, I possess huge enthusiasm in attempt to reappearing these classic games through my work on this project which is not only a combination of hardware arrangement and code program but also an opportunity of turning our knowledge into practice. Briefly, my work will require a LCD display, a simple controller involved joysticks and the microcontroller. I think the biggest difficulty I’ll encounter is the program part and I’ll try my best to figure out and adjust it to the mbed base.

*Due to this project was done long time ago, the technique report would be unavilaible, sorry.
